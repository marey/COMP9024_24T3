A process can be thought of as an instance of a running program.

Its memory space consists of:

Code area
    contains the machine code instructions for the program

    In C:
    after compiling, the machine code of functions will be put in the code area.

Data area

    Global memory area
        contains global/static variables and constant strings.
        Its size is often determined by the compiler and linker when building the program, not at run time.

        Their lifetime extends throughout the entire execution of the program.

    Heap memory area
        dynamically allocated via malloc()/free().
        C programers are responsible for calling malloc() and free().

        Variables allocated on the heap have a dynamic lifetime, controlled by the programmer.
        A heap-allocated variable itself doesn't have any name,
        so it should be accessed via a pointer variable.

    Call stack 
        dynamically-allocated due to function calls/returns.
        The push operation (creating a new frame) is caused by a function call (generated by the compiler),
        while its pop operation (removing a frame) is caused by a function return (generated by the compiler).
        It consists of stack frames (First-In-Last-Out), one for each called function.
        Each frame might contain the return address, local variables, parameters, and temporary variables.

        Since different functions can have different sets of local variables, their stack frames vary in size.

        Local variables are declared within a function and are only accessible within that function's scope.
        Their lifetime is limited to the duration of the function call in which they are declared.   

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pointer operator

    In C, the asterisk operator, *, is used to declare and manipulate pointers.

Address operator

    It is denoted as the ampersand symbol, &.


For example

    int n = 2024;
    int *ptr = &n;

                   
Its memory layout:

                --------
    ptr  ---->    2024
                --------
                 int n
