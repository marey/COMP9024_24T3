## Recursive functions



Recursive functions are functions that call themselves directly or indirectly within their definitions. 

They are a powerful tool in programming, particularly for tasks that exhibit repetitive or self-similar structures. 

```sh

Factorial(n) = n! = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) * n

Base case:     
    
    Factorial(n) = 1,    when n is 1

Recursive definition:

    Factorial(n) = 1 * 2 * 3 * ... * (n-1) * n
                 = Factorial(n-1) * n
Motivation:

    Break a large problem down into smaller, similar problems.
```

```C
long Factorial(long n) {
    if (n <= 1) {
        // the base case for the recursive function
        return 1;
    } else {
        // return Factorial(n-1) * n;
        long result = Factorial(n - 1);
        result = result * n;
        return result;
    }
}
```
However, when using recursion, it's important to understand how it interacts with the call stack.


|   Call Stack    |  Program      |

## Call Stack

Note that a call stack is a stack data structure (Last-In-First-Out) that stores information about the active functions of a running program, 

which is supported by the operating system and CPU (or by an [interpreter](https://github.com/rocky/x-python/)).

Interestingly, recursive functions depend on the call stack.

The call stack also operates on a Last-In-First-Out principle. 

**This implies that the function most recently invoked will be the first one to be removed from the call stack.**


## Stack Frame

Each time a function is called, a new stack frame (containing the return address, local variables, parameters, and temporary variables) 

is created and pushed onto the call stack. 


## The Memory Layout of a Linux Process (userspace)


A process can be thought of as an instance of a running program. 

When you start a program on your computer, the operating system creates a process to manage that program's execution. 

This process contains various resources, including memory, CPU time, and other system resources, 

which are allocated to the program as it runs.

**Due to dynamic linking, the actual layout might be more complex than the following figure.**


``` sh

    The Memory Layout of a Linux Process (userspace)

```

An executing program often partitions memory into:

```sh
Code area
    contains the machine code instructions for the program

    In C:
    after compiling, the machine code of functions will be put in the code area.
    
    // visible in all *.c files
    int test1(void) {
        return 2024;
    }

    // visible in the current *.c file containing this function
    static int test2(void) {
        return 2025;
    }

Data area

    Global memory area
        contains global/static variables and constant strings.        
        Its size is often determined by the compiler and linker when building the program, not at run time.

        global/static variables in C:

        Their lifetime extends throughout the entire execution of the program.

        // global variable, visible in all *.c files
        long year = 2024;

        // The default value of a global/static variable is 0
        // The static variable 'number' is visible in the current C file
        static int number;

        // "CSE@UNSW" is a constant string.
        // cptr is a pointer which points to the first character of "CSE@UNSW"
        char *cptr ="CSE@UNSW";

        void f(void){
            // 'count' is only visible in f()
            static int count = 0;            
            // How many times f() has been called
            count++;
        }


    Heap memory area 
        dynamically allocated via malloc()/free(), 
        C programers are responsible for calling malloc() and free().

        Python has automatic garbage collection for managing its heap memory.
        The main garbage collection mechanism in CPython is through reference counts.

        Variables allocated on the heap have a dynamic lifetime, controlled by the programmer.
        A heap-allocated variable itself doesn't have any name,
        so it should be accessed via a pointer variable.

        In C:

        void test(void) {
            long *pLong = (long *) malloc(sizeof(long));
            *pLong = 2024;
            // ...
            free(pLong);
        }

        Memory Layout:
                       --------
        pLong ---->      2024 
                       --------
                     heap-allocated variable (unnamed)

    Call stack 
        dynamically-allocated due to function calls/returns.
        The push operation (creating a new frame) is caused by a function call (generated by the compiler),
        while its pop operation (removing a frame) is caused by a function return (generated by the compiler).
        It consists of stack frames (First-In-Last-Out), one for each called function,
        Each frame might contain the return address, local variables, parameters, and temporary variables.

        Since different functions can have different sets of local variables, their stack frames vary in size.

        Local variables are declared within a function and are only accessible within that function's scope.
        Their lifetime is limited to the duration of the function call in which they are declared.

        Parameters and local variables in C:

        static void g(int n){
            int x;
            int *ptr = &n;
            // ...
        }


```

**Linux Programmer's Manual**
```sh
$ man malloc

#include <stdlib.h>

// "/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11/include/stddef.h"
// typedef long unsigned int size_t;

void *malloc(size_t size);
void free(void *ptr);

DESCRIPTION
       The malloc() function allocates size bytes and returns a pointer to the
       allocated  memory.   The memory is not initialized.  If size is 0, then
       malloc() returns either NULL, or a unique pointer value that can  later
       be successfully passed to free().

       The  free()  function  frees  the memory space pointed to by ptr, which
       must have been returned by a previous call to  malloc(),  calloc(),  or
       realloc().   Otherwise, or if free(ptr) has already been called before,
       undefined behavior occurs.  If ptr is NULL, no operation is performed.

```

**Call stack** is studied in [Stacks/Recursion](./README.md), 
[lines 553-566 in LargeAssignment/src/stmt.c](../../LargeAssignment/src/stmt.c), [lines 498-581 in LargeAssignment/src/expr.c](../../LargeAssignment/src/expr.c), and [lines 142-161 and 284-288 in LargeAssignment/src/emit.c](../../LargeAssignment/src/emit.c).

**Heap allocator** is customized in  [OurMalloc() and OurFree() of our large assignment](../../LargeAssignment/libs/SccHeap.c).

**Global variables** are generated in [EmitGlobalDeclarationNode() of our large assignment](../../LargeAssignment/src/decl.c).

**Code** is generated in [EmitFuncDefNode() of our large assignment](../../LargeAssignment/src/func.c).

## 4 A similar test case in [our large assignment](../../LargeAssignment/tests/Factorial.scc)

The following test case is not written in C, but with a simple language defined in our large assignment.

```C

// COMP9024/LargeAssignment/tests/Factorial.scc

long result;

// f(n) = 1 * 2 * ... * (n-1) * n
f(n) {
  if (SccLessEqual(n, 1)) { // n <= 1
    return 1;
  }
  else {
    return f(n-1) * n;
  }
}


main(argc, argv, env) {
  long i;
  
  i = 4;
  result = f(i);
  output(result);

  return 0;
}
```

### How to build and run the test case
```sh

LargeAssignment$ make

LargeAssignment$ make compileOne SCC_SRC_FILE=tests/Factorial.scc

./scc   < tests/Factorial.scc   > tests/Factorial.scc.s

    x86_64 assembly code generated in tests/Factorial.scc.s


LargeAssignment$ make runOne SCC_SRC_FILE=tests/Factorial.scc

24

```

[Factorial.scc.s](../Factorial.scc.s) is assembly file generated by [our large assignment](../../LargeAssignment/), 
**SCC**, a simple C-like compiler.

You can take a look at [Factorial.scc.s](../Factorial.scc.s).

The assembly code is clearly commented line by line.

If you want to know "The Stack Layout in SCC When A Function Is Called", please refer to [LargeAssignment/src/func.c](../../LargeAssignment/src/func.c).

The comments in [EmitAstExprNode() in LargeAssignment/src/expr.c](../../LargeAssignment/src/expr.c), and [EmitPrologue() and EmitEpilogue() in LargeAssignment/src/emit.c](../../LargeAssignment/src/emit.c) 

could help you understand the assembly code in [Factorial.scc.s](../Factorial.scc.s).

You can also refer to [Guide to x86-64](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs107/guide/x86-64.html).

We will discuss the details in the coming weeks.
