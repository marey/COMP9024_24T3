### Introduction

Topological sort is a way of ordering the nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in a linear sequence such that for every directed edge u -> v, node u comes before node v in the ordering.

The term “topological” reflects the idea that we are arranging nodes based on the direction of edges in a DAG.

This type of sorting is particularly useful in scenarios where certain tasks must be completed before others, such as task scheduling, course prerequisite chains, and resolving dependencies in build systems (e.g., [makefile](../../C/HowToMake/README.md)).

### Topological sort based on BFS

A DAG may have multiple valid topological sorts.

In this project, we will discuss how to perform a topological sort in a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) using Breadth-First Search (BFS).

For each node, we calculate the number of incoming edges (in-degrees). 

This helps us determine which nodes have no dependencies.

To generate a random topological sort each time this program runs, 
we randomly enqueue all nodes with an in-degree of 0.

```sh

Create a queue and randomly enqueue all nodes that have an in-degree of 0.

while (the queue is not empty) {
    dequeue a node from the front of the queue.
    add this node to the topological order list.
    for each neighboring node of the dequeued node {
        decrease its in-degree by 1.
        if the in-degree of a neighboring vertex becomes 0 {
            record the node id in an array nodeIds
        }
    }
    randomly enqueue the nodes in nodeIds

}
```

### Cycle detection in a directed graph

A topological sort is only possible if the directed graph is acyclic. 

If the graph contains cycles, a topological sort is not feasible.

However, if the number of nodes in the topological order list is less than the total number of nodes in the graph, then the graph contains a cycle.

This is because a cycle would prevent some nodes from ever reaching an in-degree of 0.

In other words, topological sort can be used to detect cycles in a directed graph.

We have discussed the format of dot files in [COMP9024/Graphs](../../Graphs/Dot2Png/README.md), how to create a directed graph in [COMP9024/Graphs/DirectedGraph](../../Graphs/DirectedGraph/README.md), and how to create an undirected graph in [COMP9024/Graphs/UndirectedGraph](../../Graphs/UndiirectedGraph/README.md).

## 3 The procedure of Topological Sort


### 3.1 make and ./main

**In addition to utilizing VS Code, we can also compile and execute programs directly from the command line interface as follows.**

``` sh

TopologicalSort$ make

TopologicalSort$ ./main
