 *******************************************************************/
``` 
**This project is designed for those looking to enhance their C programming skills after completing COMP9024.**

In this project, we will discuss how a [data stack](../../Stacks/Stack_LL/README.md) can be used to store thread IDs in a multi-threaded program and how to implement a simple web server in C.

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol ([HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP)) is the foundation of the World Wide Web, allowing webpages to be loaded through hypertext links.

The World Wide Web can be modeled as a huge [directed graph](../../Graphs/DirectedGraph/README.md).

In this graph, each node represents a webpage.

The directed edges represent hyperlinks between these webpages.

If a webpage A has a hyperlink to webpage B, there is a directed edge from A to B in the graph.

A [HashMap](../../Strings/HashMap/README.md) can be used to store the HTTP headers as follows.

#### An HTTP request from the Chrome browser

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8

...

```

If you're interested, after completing COMP9024, you can apply the knowledge gained in Database Systems to further improve this simple web server.

Additionally, incorporating a thread pool can further boost the web server's performance.



### Two fundamental principles in software design

#### High Cohesion

The parts of a program that are grouped together (like a function, class or module) are highly related and focused on a single task.

This makes each part easier to understand and maintain because it has a clear, specific role. 

#### Low Coupling

Minimizing dependencies between different parts of a program.

When different parts of a program (like functions, classes or modules) are loosely connected, changes in one part don’t heavily affect others. 

This makes the program more flexible and easier to update. 

## 1 How to download this project in [CSE VLAB](https://vlabgateway.cse.unsw.edu.au/)

Open a terminal (Applications -> Terminal Emulator)

```sh

$ git clone https://github.com/sheisc/COMP9024.git

$ cd COMP9024/C/SimpleWebServer

SimpleWebServer$ 

```


## 2 How to start [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to browse/edit/debug a project.

```sh

SimpleWebServer$ code

```

Two configuration files (SimpleWebServer/.vscode/[launch.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/launch-json-reference) and SimpleWebServer/.vscode/[tasks.json](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks)) have been preset.



#### 2.1 Open the project in VS Code

In the window of Visual Studio Code, please click "File" and "Open Folder",

select the folder "COMP9024/C/SimpleWebServer", then click the "Open" button.


#### 2.2 Build the project in VS Code

click **Terminal -> Run Build Task**


#### 2.3 Debug the project in VS Code

Open src/WebServer.c, and click to add a breakpoint (say, line 186).

Then, click **Run -> Start Debugging**

### 2.4 Directory

```sh

    |
    └── tasks.json       specifying which task to run (e.g., 'make' or 'make clean')
                         used when you click "Terminal -> Run Build Task" or "Terminal -> Run Task"
```

Makefile is discussed in [COMP9024/C/HowToMake](../../C/HowToMake/README.md).


## 3 The main procedure


### 3.1 Build and run the program from the command line interface


``` sh

SimpleWebServer$ make

SimpleWebServer$ ./main


```

### 3.2 Use a browser as the client

http://localhost:8080

#### HTTP request from the Chrome browser

```sh
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/114.0.0.0 Safari/537.36
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br
Accept-Language: en-GB,en-US;q=0.9,en;q=0.8

...

```
#### Display the HTTP response from the web server
| HTML page | 
|:-------------:|
| <img src="images/SimpleWebServer.png" width="80%" height="80%"> |



### 3.3 Use nc as the client

**The tool nc is not available in CSE VLAB.**

Install Netcat on Debian/Ubuntu Linux

```sh
sudo apt install netcat
```

#### HTTP request from nc

``` sh

$ echo -e "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 8080

GET / HTTP/1.1
Connection: close

```




#### HTTP response from the simple web server

```sh
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 134

<html>
<head>
<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1"></head>
<body>
<h1> Hello. Your ticket number is 00000015. </h1>
</body>
</html>
```

#### 404 Not Found

```sh
echo -e "GET /xxx HTTP/1.1\r\nConnection: close\r\n\r\n" | nc localhost 8080

HTTP/1.1 404 Not Found
Server: Apache
Connection: close
Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 70

<html>
<head>
</head>
<body>
<h1> 404 Not Found </h1>
