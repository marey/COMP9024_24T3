# Tutorials

## Introduction

### 1. In each one-hour tutorial, our tutors will help you analyze and understand one runnable C program.

If you have any questions in the program, do not hesitate to raise up your hands.


### 2. Programming is inherently hands-on, requiring active engagement to truly grasp concepts and develop proficiency. 

While slides can provide valuable information and insights, practical application through reading and writing programs 
is crucial for reinforcing understanding and gaining practical skills. 

### 3. Start with reading, debugging and modifying a runnable program. 

We understand that learning C, data structures and algorithms in one term is extremely challenging, 

especially considering that many of you did not major in Computer Science and Engineering during your undergraduate studies.

Please start with reading, debugging and modifying a runnable program.

Even adding a [printf()](./Week2/src/BubbleSort.c) into the program will help you further understand it.

We will use **Visual Studio Code**, **make** and **gcc** in [CSE VLAB](https://vlabgateway.cse.unsw.edu.au/).

You can also setup your own [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) in your own computers.

Your comprehension of these programs will be assessed in quizzes and examinations.
